It's ok to use ViewModel as mediator between View and Business logic such as DungeonManager
DungeonManager does know nothing about View
DungeonView does know nothing about DungeonManager


I can generate randomly not via DungeonMapGenerator but by something like randomDungeonSchemeGenerator to get something like:

"R" "C" "E"
"RE" - mean Room with Enemy
"RR" - mean Room with Reward
and so on
