// Notes and ideas

https://github.com/gilecheverria/UP_Battle_Project/blob/master/design.txt
This link about simple file like this one with all classes/properties/methods in hierarchy to observe it's relationship and project struct. Feels bette then Mural

if you want to separate a class or a service just make it's property as privates and you will see what parts of the code requires modification to fix errors

// MARK: 1 Main function start() with start/menu/welcome sound

// MARK: 2 Second function update() to constantly observe our game.



// Narrator should be the hero own voice of madness 

// add animation when you enter new room. Just a simple visual effect on the screen borders like a light should move from top to bottom and vice versa. Something simple

// Kill monsters fast / think less to get a bonus of collecting soul/black power because of your cold heart decision making. To increase game speed especially on easier levels

// Swipes on the screen in special order to activate special skills and improve it's damage/effect. Analogue is GearsOfWars with nice recharge -> more damage/slower recharge

// Map of Locations:
- Town (In, BlackSmith, Store, Alch)
- Dungeon
- Cursed Charch
- Place to rechard inside the Dungeon
- Dungeon Room
- Dungeon Corridor


What I meant is separating logic out of the ViewModel entirely â€” into dedicated classes or services, for example:

class HeroActionManager {
	func performAttack(hero: inout Character, enemy: inout Character) -> Int { ... }
	func performHeal(hero: inout Character) -> Bool { ... }
	// etc
}

Then in RoomViewModel, you'd just call:
let damage = heroActions.performAttack(hero: &hero, enemy: &enemy)

GameState Over-Reliance

class GameState {
	var dungeonState: DungeonState
	var roomState: RoomState
	var combatState: CombatState
	// etc.
}

GameStates:
- Menu
- Global Map
- Local Map
- Combat

I still can add Attack/Neutral/Defence stances to the game
Attack Stance -> + 10% of melee damage, no spells/def abilities allowed (can use charge)
Defence Stance -> + 10% of defence, no spells, attack abilities allowed (can use stun)
Neutral Stance -> almost all abilities and magic allowed no bonus damage/def

in my game we use room based dungeon map via DArkest Dungeon. No models only some kind of event. At this room we got nothing/quest/chest/trap/enemy

Top part of the RoomScreen can be changes in the same way as we can change a menu. If there is no enemy put the chest/quest/event here

Add different types of room with different effects for both enemies and allies
Example: Poisoned Swamp -> damages allies and give benefits to slymes

Now i have relationship like:
RoomGameState -> extractSnapshot -> use in RoomGameManager/RoomViewModel

Any actions should be wrapped to RoomGameStateSnapshot and to be applyed to GameState back
