Current Plan

1. Connect DungeonMapModule with RoomModule
	- Create enemy event inside the room
	- Create a trigger to enter room when user encounter it


100. Model Navigation as Data (see my Menu Module and Path)
	You don't need Coordinator because it's antipattern

101. All dependencies should be defined and created in CompositionRoot - AppDependencies class at the start of the app so they can be passed to screens for creation. IT'S NOT A DI CONTAINER BECAUSE IT'S RESOLVED DURING COMPILATION STAGE AND NOT A RUNTIME AS SWIFTJECT AND OTHER SUPPOSED TO BE
