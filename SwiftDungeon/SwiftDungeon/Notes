Current Plan

1. Add current level of the char or enemy

3. add isGameOn toggle to the View and create a separate GameOverScreen so it will be presented only is toggle is true

// Notes and ideas

// MARK: Things to add
// Add toggles for different areas or screens to display
// isInventoryOpen: Bool = false
// ifSkillSetOpen: Bool = false
// isFightOn: Bool = false
// and so on


// Narrator should be the hero own voice of madness 

// add animation when you enter new room. Just a simple visual effect on the screen borders like a light should move from top to bottom and vice versa. Something simple

// Kill monsters fast / think less to get a bonus of collecting soul/black power because of your cold heart decision making. To increase game speed especially on easier levels

// Swipes on the screen in special order to activate special skills and improve it's damage/effect. Analogue is GearsOfWars with nice recharge -> more damage/slower recharge

// Map of Locations:
- Town (In, BlackSmith, Store, Alch)
- Dungeon
- Cursed Charch
- Place to rechard inside the Dungeon
- Dungeon Room
- Dungeon Corridor
